I am a Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) in San Francisco,
working on video and language understanding using deep neural networks and large multimodal models.

At Google I've worked on self-supervised multimodal models for [video and language representation learning](https://research.google/blog/learning-cross-modal-temporal-representations-from-unlabeled-videos/),
open sourcing state-of-the-art [object detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) methods, [capturing special video moments for Google Photos](https://research.google/blog/capturing-special-video-moments-with-google-photos/) users, and leveraging large multimodal models for [AI-generated video in YouTube](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/made-on-youtube-2023/). Previously, I also worked at [Google X](https://x.company/) and [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) on perception for self-driving cars.

I did my Ph.D. at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/)
advised by [Yiannis Aloimonos](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~yiannis/) and [Cornelia Ferm√ºller](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~fer/), 
where I worked on understanding the functionality of object parts to enable tool-use for everyday robots.
I'm interested in computer vision, deep learning, generative models, large multimodal models, and robotics.
